Recipe App
This repository contains the code for a recipe app built using React and ChakraUI. The app retrieves data from the Edamam recipe API and allows users to:

-Browse a list of recipes: Each recipe displays its name, picture, diet label (if present), cautions (if present), meal type, dish type, and health labels (vegan, vegetarian, etc.).
-Search for recipes: Users can filter recipes by name and/or health labels.
-View detailed information: Clicking on a recipe displays a detailed page with information like total cooking time, ingredients, servings, and total nutrients.
-Navigate back: Users can navigate back to the recipe list from the detailed recipe page.
